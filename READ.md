## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Clean and easy peasy discord.js model to Getting Started

## ü§î Get discord token <a name = "token"></a>

Go to:  [Discord Applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and hit the **New Application** button.  After that go to **Bot** menu and hit the **Add bot** button to get your own discord token, don't share with anyone your token. You will need this token to put in the .env file.

Still in [Discord Applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) you will need to click in OAuth menu and hit the **bot** scopes, after that under this menu you will see a generated link, you can add permission that your bot will have and that's it.

### Install dependencies
`$ npm install`

### Run your application in development mode

## Preparing for production
In my case I run this application in Elastic Bean Stalk, but you are free to use anything you want. Go to the root directory of your project and zip your project runing this comand

`$ zip ../botteste2.zip -r *`

**Note: If you are running in a Windows system I do recommend you to install Ubuntu for Windows system in Microsoft Store, after that you can `sudo apt install zip` to have full power and run the command above**
